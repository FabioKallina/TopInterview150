/**
To convert a top-down solution to a bottom-up one: 
1.  Initialize an array dp that is sized according to the state variables. 
    For example, let's say the input to the problem was an array nums and an integer k that represents the maximum number of actions allowed. 
    Your array dp would be 2D with one dimension of length nums.length and the other of length k. 
    In the top-down approach, we had a function dp. We want these two to be equivalent. For example, the value of dp(4, 6) can now be found in dp[4][6].

2.  Set your base cases, same as the ones you are using in your top-down function. In the example we just looked at, we had dp(0) = dp(1) = 0. 
    We can initialize our dp array values to 0 to implicitly set this base case. As you'll see soon, other problems will have more complicated base cases.
    
3.  Write a for-loop(s) that iterate over your state variables. If you have multiple state variables, you will need nested for-loops. 
    These loops should start iterating from the base cases and end at the answer state.

4.  Now, each iteration of the inner-most loop represents a given state, and is equivalent to a function call to the same state in top-down. 
    Copy-paste the logic from your function into the for-loop and change the function calls to accessing your array. All dp(...) changes into dp[...].

5.  We're done! dp is now an array populated with the answer to the original problem for all possible states. 
    Return the answer to the original problem, by changing return dp(...) to return dp[...].
